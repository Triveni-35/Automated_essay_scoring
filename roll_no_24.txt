Global warming is a serius threat to our planet. It is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The rise in temperatures leads to extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity. If we do not take immediate action to mitigate climate change, the consequences could be dire. We need to reduce our carbon footprints and invest in renewable energy sources.
