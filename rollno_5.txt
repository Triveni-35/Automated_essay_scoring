Expository essays explain a topic neutrally. Writers use expository essays to demonstrate their knowledge or expertise in a certain area. Teachers often assign expository essays to test their students' understanding of a topic. These essays often avoid emotion or opinion and instead focus on factual information. For instance, if you're writing about environmental conservation, try to avoid claiming someone should do something or taking a stance on a controversial issue. Expository essays can take different formats, but they typically include:
An introduction with a thesis statement explaining exactly what the essay will discuss
The body that details the facts of the subject, often citing sources
A conclusion that summarizes the main points
